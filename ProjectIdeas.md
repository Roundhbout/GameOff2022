- Hindsight is 20/20
- blunt words have the sharpest edge
    - a “pen is mightier than the sword” type game where you defeat opponents through well-chosen and straightforward responses to their dialogue

- Burn the midnight oil
    - in which you play as a student witch trying to finish their homework at night before an oil lamp goes out.

- Already Done for You
    - Another character in the story has already accomplished one of your objectives. 
    - Story driven rpg-like game where whenever you get to a major roadblock someone (maybe a speedrunner lmao) has already cleared it and in the end you do *nothing* but just navigate.

- Excessive dialogue doesn't stop time
    - Oftentimes there are major lore dumps through silent subtitled dialogue.
    - Whole game is MC getting into long dialogues with other characters, but the real world still persists during this, and hazards just so happen to be inbound whenever you enter a long-winded dialogue
    - Game revolves mashing through dialogue and making the correct choices in spite of not having enough time to read.
    - NPCs can react to character skipping their dialogue and get confused/upset by it.

- Dressed to kill
    - I guess this is already true in many games because of stat increases from armor, but it was a thought I had.  Kind of like how Yor wears her black dress when she’s working.  You’re an assassin for hire, and you need to pick the right outfit or disguise to be able to approach your target and eliminate them without getting caught.

- Flip the bird
    - Bird on a diving board
    - Bird jump and do a flip
    - Bird land(?) flip
    - ???
    - Profit

- Defeat means playable
    - When you beat a character you unlock them for play
    - Maybe another cliche to go along with this but as a meme: when you defeat an enemy for them to join your party, the game's all like "Wow! You've unlocked <x>!!!" and you go to swap to them and they're just an injured, crumpled mess cuz you beat them up.

- Bosses explode upon defeat (after a slight pause from the last attack and they do that :O face)
    - starts with like one explosion, rapidly picks up in more explosions, one final big explosion
    - regardless of what material the boss consists of
    - maybe make everything upon damage/destruction do this? let your shield get broken so you can throw it like a captain america grenade

- March to the beat of a different drummer
    - F#ck that, march to the beat of your own drum!
    - Rhythm-esque side scroller platformer?
    - Levels have a BPM and/or sound track at a given BPM
    - Each action must be done along that BPM, and corresponds with a different instrument noise
        - Step forward 1 square by pressing z or x (snare + hi hat?, kick + snare? alternate kick hat snare hat despite only using two buttons?)
        - Jump with space or up arrow (cymbal crash?, 2 beats)
        - Slide with down arrow? (long hi-hat?, 2 beats)
    - Level lost by colliding with obstacle
    - option for *funky obstacles*
        - triplet steps to add sub-beat presses?
    - timing window can be based on BPM'
    - amen breaks somewhere in there
    - could do this with other instruments possibly, maybe a horn to "toot your own horn"
- Make a statement without saying a word
    - Silent protagonists are pretty prevalent, and could also be considered cliché.  Maybe a game where the protagonist communicates via charades
- The world is your oyster
    - Game of life (board game)
    - Freedom of being self-directed like a sandbox game
    - Branching paths to develop and explore the world
    - Interact-ables and Minigames invite you to progress, develop relationships with NPCs, and do whatever you want within reason.
    - Inspired also from Stardew Valley
- Cliché otome visual novel
    - clearly subversion is possible (thank you DDLC)
    - I think a fun one could be that you actually just become friends with everyone instead and romancing anyone was never an option.
    - Soft vibes.
- Money can't buy you happiness & Money is the root of all evil
    - A rpg as an unsuspecting merchant where through running your business you discover the literal corruption of wealth, and how it affects everyone.  How you run your business with this knowledge is how you could save your city from money or succumb to it yourself.
    - The game would not tell the player the true nature of the currency, so if the player uncovers nothing and only amasses wealth, their choices will slowly be restricted to evil ones.  In this scenario the game would end once the merchant is no longer good.
